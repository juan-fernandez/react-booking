# react-booking

React component used for the management of resource booking

```
git clone git@github.com:juan-fernandez/react-booking.git

cd react-booking

npm install

npm run dev
```
Next:

* handle the selected dates in the state of the component (pass as props)
* better looking
* add dates / remove dates (automatic new grid when shifting?)
* substitute double click to add a date? distinguish between clicking and shifting? 
* how to export it in a single component?
